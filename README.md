# [MVP] E-Commerce Side Project

This project aims to develop a completely **functional, monitorable and production-ready** monolithic E-Commerce,
avoiding ~~unecessary
gourmetized over-engineering~~ complexity in its initial phase as much as possible.

Once the monolithic MVP is _operational_,
_**_the plan is to transition it into a distributed system of microservices_**_ using
methodologies like the _Strangler Pattern_.

## Objective

- Create a complete end-to-end E-Commerce system encompassing:
    - Backend
    - Frontend
    - Testing suite
    - Infrastructure as Code
    - CI/CD pipelines
    - Monitoring
    - Comprehensive documentation

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to serve as a basis for my personal _SaaS_, in addition to obtaining deep insights and
learning through the **_pains_** of the entire development process and its respective migration from a monolithic system
to a
distributed system.
